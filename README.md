# Google-Gemini-1.5-Flash-Image-Processing-Java-Spring-Boot-without-VertexAPI
A Java Spring Boot API for interacting with Google Gemini to upload images, process prompts, and generate content seamlessly. This integration leverages Google AI Studio’s free-tier API for limited use, making it accessible for developers interested in AI-powered image analysis and content generation.


# Google Gemini API Java Integration

This open-source project provides a Java Spring Boot service and controller to interact with Google Gemini's image processing and content generation features via a REST API.

## Overview

This integration offers a streamlined way to upload images, process them with a text prompt, and receive content responses using Google's Gemini model. It leverages a free API key option available through Google AI Studio for limited free usage, making it accessible for non-commercial and experimental use cases. This project is especially helpful for those who want to experiment with Google's Gemini API without committing to paid tiers.

## Features

- **Upload Images**: Enables multipart image uploads to Google’s service, allowing images to be analyzed or used in content generation.
- **Text & Image Prompting**: Integrates both image and text inputs for more dynamic content generation results.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Users can customize API keys and request parameters easily.
- **Open Source & Customizable**: Designed to be modifiable for diverse use cases, making it a great resource for developers interested in AI integrations.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Java JDK** 11 or later
- **Maven**: To manage dependencies and build the project
- **Google API Key**: Obtainable through Google AI Studio for accessing Gemini’s API

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Google-Gemini-1.5-Flash-Image-Processing-Java-Spring-Boot-without-VertexAPI.git
   cd Google-Gemini-1.5-Flash-Image-Processing-Java-Spring-Boot-without-VertexAPI
   ```

2. **Configure API Key**:  
   Open the `application.properties` file and add your Google API key.
   ```properties
   google.api.key=YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY
   ```


## Usage

The API exposes an endpoint for uploading images and sending prompts, which allows you to interact with Google’s Gemini API seamlessly.

### Endpoint: `POST /gemini/process-image`

- **Parameters**:
    - `file` (MultipartFile): The image file you want to process.
    - `prompt` (String): Text prompt associated with the image to guide the content generation.
- **Response**:
    - The endpoint returns a JSON structure that includes a success code, message, and data generated by Google Gemini.

**Example Request (using cURL)**:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/gemini/process-image"      -F "file=@/path/to/your/image.jpg"      -F "prompt=Describe the content of this image."
```

## Customization

This project allows you to modify various parameters and processing logic to suit different applications:

1. **Modify Request Parameters**:
   Adjust properties like `temperature`, `topK`, and `topP` within the `GeminiApiService.java` class to control how the Gemini model processes your input, influencing the randomness and creativity of the output.

2. **Parse Response**:
   If your application requires a different format or subset of the response, you can customize how the response from Google Gemini is parsed or formatted by editing the service’s response handling logic.

3. **Extend Functionality**:
   Users can add additional API endpoints or integrate further with Google’s AI services to expand functionality beyond the initial image and text generation tasks.
